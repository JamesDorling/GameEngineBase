# GameEngineBase
The base of a game engine.

Implemented are both 2D and 3D renderers, as well as cameras for both. These all use OpenGL, but I made it easy to implement other interfaces.
(Namely Vulkan, Direct X and Windows32.)
This code will not work if cloned from here, as it is lacking multiple files, namely the "vendor" folder which stores a lot of used libraries.

THIS IS NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT OF TIGER WOULDNT'S. 
Unfortunately, as Tiger Wouldn'ts was a university project, I have lost the code for it.
